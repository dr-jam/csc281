		<h3>Examinations</h3> There will be a midterm and final examination for this course. Each will be worth 15 of the 30 points allocated to Examinations.</p>

		<h3>Homework and Quizzes</h3>

		<p>The build of the work for this course will be in the form of homework assignments centered around problem solving with programming and exercising mastery over concepts in computer science. The majority of the homework assignments will be individual
			and take two weeks to complete. Quizzes will be rare and only given when critical topics need reinforcement.</p>

		<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>

		<p>As this is a core course in the degree program, attending all classes is highly encouraged. There will be no penalty for missing up to two classes (excluding excused absences). Missing the third or fourth class meeting will result in a 5 point deduction
			from your Attendance and Participation points. Any further absences will result in a failing grade.</p>

		<p>Participation will be assessed by engagement in and out of the classroom. The primary mode of participation is completing the assigned readings on time and with a high degree of comprehension. Full participation in class activities, speaking during
			discussion, asking questions, and attending office hours are excellent ways to bolster your participation grade.</p>

		<h3>Late Work</h3>

		<p>Work is expected to be finished and submitted at the specified due dates. Work submitted after the deadline may not be accepted. You will receive one 24 hour extension for a single assignment.</p>

		<h2>Green Teaching</h2>
		<p>This is a Certified Green Course. This means, for example, that I will not hand out any printed materials, but I will use Blackboard extensively to post handouts, collect assignments, and provide you with feedback on assignments. To help make our class
			as green as possible, I encourage you to buy used books, minimize paper use by submitting assignments electronically as instructed, and read course readings online rather than printing copies. If you choose to print, please print double-sided, and
			recycle the paper after the end of the semester.</p>

		<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
		<p>In the event of a declared pandemic (influenza or other communicable disease), American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community. Should the university be required to close for a period of time,	we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional
			format and/or use of distance instructional methods. Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency. Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via AU e-mail
			and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence due to illness. Students are responsible for checking their AU e-mail regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies. In the event of a declared pandemic
			or other emergency, students should refer to the AU Web site (american.edu/emergency) and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean’s office for course
			and school/college-specific information.</p>

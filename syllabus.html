	<h3>Examinations</h3>

	<h3>Homework</h3>

	<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>

	<p>As this is a core course in the degree program, attending all classes is highly encouraged. There will be no penalty for missing up to two classes (exluding excused absenses). Missing the third or fourth class meeting will result in a 5 point dection from your Attendance and Participation points. Any further absences will result in a failing grade.</p>

	<p>Participation will be assessed by engagement in and out of the classroom. Full participation in class activities, speaking during discussion, asking questions, and attending office hours are excellent ways to bolster your participation grade.</p>

	<h2>Technology in the Classroom Policy</h2>
	<p>The use of laptops and technology in general are encouraged in this course as long as they are not disruptive to the rest of the class. Please ask for permission before video or audio recording in the classroom. In general, students will be treated as adults capable of managing their technological lives while being respectful of others in the classroom.</p>

	<h2>Social Media Policy</h2>
	<p>Students are not permitted to make visual or audio recordings, including live streaming, of classroom lectures or any class related content, using any type of recording devices (e.g., smart phone, computer, digital recorder, etc.) unless prior permission from the instructor is obtained, and there are no objections from any of the students in the class. If permission is granted, personal use and sharing of recordings and any electronic copies of course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes and any classroom discussions online or otherwise) is limited to the personal use of students registered in the course and for educational purposes only, even after the end of the course. Exceptions will be made for student who present a signed Letter of Accommodation from the Academic Support and Access Center. See: Documentation and Eligibility.</p>
	<p>To supplement the classroom experience, lectures may be audio or video recorded by faculty and made available to students registered for this class. Faculty may record classroom lectures or discussions for pedagogical use, future student reference, or to meet the accommodation needs of students with a documented disability. These recordings are limited to personal use and may not be distributed (fileshare), sold, or posted on social media outlets without the written permission of faculty.</p>
	<p>Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of any part of a recorded lecture or course materials. or using information for purpose other than the student's own learning may be deemed a violation of American University's Student Code of Conduct and subject to disciplinary action (see Student Conduct Code VI.

	<p>This is a Certified Green Course.

To help make our class as green as possible, I encourage you to buy used books, minimize paper use by submitting assignments electronically as instructed, and read course readings online rather than printing copies. If you choose to print, please print double-sided, and recycle the paper after the end of the semester.</p>

	<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>
	<p>In the event of a declared pandemic (influenza or other communicable disease), American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community. Should the university be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional format and/or use of distance instructional methods. Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency. Faculty will communicate class-specific information to students via AU e-mail and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence due to illness. Students are responsible for checking their AU e-mail regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies. In the event of a declared pandemic or other emergency, students should refer to the AU Web site (american.edu/emergency) and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean’s office for course and school/college-specific information.</p>
